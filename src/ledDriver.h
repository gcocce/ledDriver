 *
 * Links are generated automatically for webpages (like http://www.google.co.uk)
 * and for structures, like BoxStruct_struct. For typedef-ed types use
 * #BoxStruct.
 * For functions, automatic links are generated when the parenthesis () follow
 * the name of the function, like Box_The_Function_Name().
 * Alternatively, you can use #Box_The_Function_Name.
 * @return @c NULL is always returned.
